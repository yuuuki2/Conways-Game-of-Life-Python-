# Conways-Game-of-Life-Python-
I want sleep


Implement Conway's Game of Life [0] in Python. The playing field size should be dynamic, and the starting state should be read from a file containing 0s and 1s. The playing field should be infinitely large (i.e. after coordinate (MAX-1) comes 0). Use Turtle to display the game graphically. Bonus points for visualizing state transitions (dead->alive, etc.). No global variables are allowed. The entry point is main(). Divide the program into multiple functions, at least: playfield_init, playfield_read, playfield_swap, count_living, check_rules, and playfield_draw. Generate function documentation using doxygen [1] [2]. In addition to the functions, there should be a page explaining the Game of Life.
